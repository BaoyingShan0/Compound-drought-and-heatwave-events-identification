# 🐍 Voting for Python Version

As fewer and fewer people are using heavy and non-free **MATLAB**, I'm considering developing a **Python version** of this method.  
At the moment, I'm weighing the *time investment* against the *practical need*.  

Let me know what you think by submitting your vote via the link below:

💬 If the number of votes is **greater than <u>10</u>**,  
I’ll go ahead and develop the **Python implementation**.

Thanks for your feedback! 🙌
